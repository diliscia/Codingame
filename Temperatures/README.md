# Temperatures
## The Goal
The purpose is to analyze records of temperature and to find the closest to zero.
##	Rules
You have to write a program which output is the temperature closest to 0 in the input data. If there are two numbers equally close to zero you have to choose the positive integer  closest to zero (example, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).
## Game Input
The program have to read the data from the standard input and write the result on the standard output.
## Input
**Line 1: N**: number of temperatures to analyze
**Line 2: A**: string of **N** temperatures as integers (from -273 to 5526)

## Output
Must display 0 (zero) if the no temperatures are provided (**N** = 0). Otherwise, display the temperature that is closest to 0.
## Constraints
0 â‰¤ N < 10000
## Example
Input
5
1 -2 -8 4 5

Output
1
