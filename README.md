CodinGame is a challenge-based training platform for programmers and its purpose is to let programmers keep on improving their coding skills by solving the World's most challenging problems, learn new concepts, and get inspired by the best developers.

## Proposals
Here I'm posting my solutions for CodinGame Puzzles (https://www.codingame.com/home) as I'm advancing through the proposed activities.

I have created a folder for each puzzle I'm advancing and within each you will find a **readme.md** that explains the puzzle and the strategy I used to solve it. You will find also the files that correspond to the solutions. I've solved some of the puzzles in diferent languages (C++, Python, Java, JavaScript and Bash). 

The Puzzles I've done so far are:

**Name** / Languages Solved 

**ASCII Art** / C++, Python, Java

**Chuck Norris** / C++, Python 

**Defibrillators** / C++, Python

**Horse-Racing Duals** / C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, Bash

**MIME Type** / C++, Python

**Mars Lander - Episode 1** / C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, Bash

**Power Of Thor - Episode 1** / C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, Bash

**Shadows of the Knight - Episode 1** / C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript

**Temperatures** / C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, Bash

**The Descent** / C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, Bash
